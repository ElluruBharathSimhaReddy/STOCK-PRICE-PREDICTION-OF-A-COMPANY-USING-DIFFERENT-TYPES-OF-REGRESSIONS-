STOCK PRICE PREDICTION OF A COMPANY USINGDIFFERENT TYPES OF REGRESSIONS

## Problem Statement
In financial markets, accurate prediction of stock prices is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Various machine learning algorithms can be applied to predict stock prices, including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Predicting the Stock Price of a Company Using Linear Regression, Logistic Regression
and Support Vector Regression. And also finding which Regression is best among three
to Predict the Stock Price of a Company.

## Problem Solving
The goal of this project is to compare the performance of Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Regression are implemented using appropriate libraries or frameworks. Each model is trained on the training dataset to learn the underlying patterns in the data, for predicting the stock price of a company. The objective is to determine which regression algorithm yields the best predictive performance in terms of accuracy and robustness.
